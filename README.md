- Hi, I'm Edu.
- I'm studying computer science at Anhembi Morumbi - Mooca São Paulo.
- Hobbies: Videos games, books and learning.

- Studying Computer Science, looking for an internship in the IT area (I'm looking for experience).
- I seek to learn and improve my knowledge. I'm focusing my studies (on my own, outside of college subjects) on Back-end development and software testing.
- I am available to work hybrid and online (in person I do not have Thursday and Friday mornings available because of the college).
